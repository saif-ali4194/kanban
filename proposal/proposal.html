				<b>To Do List</b><br />
				After analyzing all the websites, I have identified a problem of "Time
				Managment". There are different websites<br />
				like trello, Click Up, todolist etc. where you can sign in and make
				different task. User can create, delete and modify the tasks. He/she<br />can
				also give priority to different tasks.User can modify his user account.
				These web apps also email you about the tasks along<br />
				with the deadline as a remainder.Managing time can sometimes hard to do
				especially when your a programmer. You need to manage your different<br />
				tasks in timely manner. I personally use Click Up all the time. Thus
				Time Managment is a problem that I personally face everyday.<br /><br />
				In my To Do List App a user will be able to make a new task. He will be
				able to assign deadlines to different tasks, after which the task will
				expire.<br />
				User will be able to modify the task. He will be able to give priority
				to different tasks. He/She will be able<br />
				to delete the task. User will be able to register and login. Because
				this is a feature that all Web Apps have.
